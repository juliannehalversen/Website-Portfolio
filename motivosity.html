								<h2>The Project</h2>
                                <p>I was hired on as a developer at Motivosity to work on their corporate website. It really needed some help when I started, it had about 4 different JS frameworks jumbled together, outdated dependencies, and folders of full size stock images never in use. 
									Along with the techinical part being a little bit of a mess, the design of the site was not consistent with the brand image we wanted to display.
									We had several different types of imagery, inconsistent user flows, and a user experience that left us feeling like we weren't serving the user like we want and need to. 
									On this project I worked closey with our copywriter and our UX designer. It was definitely challenging being the only developer and really the only technical person on the marketing team. 
									On top on doing it solo, we had an extremely tight deadline because we were presenting our new brand image at a conference a mere two months away. Because the technical condition of the 
									current website was so poor I decided to scratch it and build it correctly from the ground up. I knew it would take more effort but it was by far the best long term solution. Between keeping our old site
									 updated with blogs, press releases, images, and content, it was a stretch to create a whole new site at the same time.</p>
								<p>Long story short, we crushed it! It was a ton of work on not only on the technical side but making sure that we are presenting our brand and message to our users in an appropriate way. 
									Another fun piece to the project was also making sure it was completely SEO friendly, especially where the old one wasn't. This took even more time to do properly but 
									after the site had been live for a few weeks we started to notice the huge increase in traffic and the benefits of an optimized site. Of course, a project is never done. There are ALWAYS technical aspects to add/update,
									content, product requests, new features, SEO improvements, performance audits, A/B testing and using any and all new technology that I can get my hands on!
                                </p>
